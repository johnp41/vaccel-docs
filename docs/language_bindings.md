# Frameworks and Language bindings

To facilitate the use of vAccel, we provide bindings for popular languages,
apart from `C`. Essentially, the vAccel `C` API can be called from any language
that interacts with `C` libraries. Building on this, we provide support for
Python and Rust, while we are working on extending support for various other
high- or low-level languages.

Additionally, we have implemented a subset of Tensorflow and PyTorch APIs in a
way that the user can execute an application written for those frameworks over
vAccel with minimal and/or no changes.
